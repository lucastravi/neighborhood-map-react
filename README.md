# Neighborhood Map - React JS
This web app is a project for Udacity - Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree.

## About
This application uses React JS to build a interactive map using Google Maps API, placing markers of my favorite places in Gramado - RS. You can click on the markers to look for additional information grabbed from Foursquare, and the web application also contains a clickable list with all the locations where you can pop-up information about some location just clicking on its name. The application also offers a search bar that makes easy to filter the location items and the markers placed on the map.
